    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team1[0] = 'Team 1';
    console.log(players, team1);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[0] = 'Team 2';

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[0] = 'Team 3';

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; // <-- My Preference
    team4[0] = 'Team 4';

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[0] = 'Team 5';

    console.log(team1, team2, team3, team4, team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const myDog = {
      name: 'Kona Phelps',
      age: 9,
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const oldDog = myDog;
    oldDog.age = 14;
    console.log(myDog,oldDog);
    myDog.age = 9; // Put it back for illustrative purposes.

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const youngerOldDog = Object.assign({}, myDog, { age: 13, color: 'grey' });
    console.log(myDog, youngerOldDog);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...myDog};
    console.log(cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
